*** Functions ***

23. A function is an independent block of code that performs a specific task, while a function expression is a way to store functions in variables.

A function argument is the value we pass to the function, while a function parameter is a placeholder that stores the argument passed to the function.

We can pass different arguments in each call, making the function re-usable and dynamic.

JavaScript Library Functions
JavaScript provides some built-in functions that can be directly used in our program. We don't need to create these functions; we just need to call them.
Example : console.log(), Math.sqrt()
Like with functions, we need to use parentheses () with the variable name to call a function expression.

Use a function expression when:
you need a function that isn't hoisted. the function should only used when it is defined. the function is anonymous, or doesn't need a name for later use.

A function declaration can not be called at the same time when it was created, while a function expression can be used as an IIFE which means we can call it immediately after defining it.

In JavaScript, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed within the code.
Variables can be declared in different scopes:
Global Scope
Local (Function) Scope
Block-Level Scope

The value of a global variable can be changed inside a function. 

It is a good practice to avoid using global variables because the value of a global variable can change in different areas of the program. This can lead to unknown results.

JavaScript has a strict mode in which a variable cannot be used without declaring it.

24. JavaScript ES6 introduced block-level scoping with the let and const keywords.
Block-level variables are accessible only within the block {} they are defined in, which can be smaller than a function's scope. 

25. hoisting is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration. There are generally two types of hoistings in JavaScript:
Variable Hoisting
Function Hoisting

the behavior of hoisting varies depending on whether a variable is declared using var, let, or const.

When we declare a variable using var, it is hoisted to the top of its current scope.
console.log(test);
var test = 5;
// Output: undefined
cause, variable is hoisted with the default value of undefined.

26. When we declare a variable using let or const, it is hoisted to the top of its current scope. However, the variable does not have a default value when it is hoisted (unlike when declared using var).
console.log(message);
let message;
Output : ReferenceError: Cannot access 'message' before initialization.

Here, the error occurs because a variable declared with let is not assigned any default value when hoisted.
We know the message variable was hoisted because the error message "Cannot access 'message' before initialization" indicates that JavaScript is aware that message exists.
Had the variable not been hoisted, we'd get a different error, i.e., ReferenceError: message is not defined.
Initializations Are Not Hoisted.

27. function hoisting allows us to call the function before its declaration.
Function Expressions are not hoisted.
When we use a function expression, we cannot call it before its declaration. 

28. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem. 
JavaScript does have a recursion limit.
The recursion limit prevents errors caused by too many nested function calls.
However, the limit varies depending on the JavaScript engine and the environment in which the code is running.
For instance, the maximum limit can differ between Firefox and Chrome. Whereas, devices with higher memory might have higher recursion limits than devices with less memory.

29. When there is no base case in a recursive function, it runs infinitely, resulting in an infinite recursion.
