* Most commonly used Git commands :
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of their work.

1. git init :
Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This is the first command used to create a new repository.
Example> git init

2. git clone :
Copies an existing Git repository (from a remote server or local directory) to your local machine.
Example>
git clone <repository_url>

3. git status :
Displays the state of the working directory and staging area. It shows which files have been modified, which files are staged, and which are not being tracked.
Example> git status

4. git add :
Adds files to the staging area. You use this command before committing changes.
Example>
git add <file_name>  # Adds a specific file
git add .            # Adds all changes in the current directory

5. git commit :
Records the changes in the repository with a message describing what changes were made.
Example>
Example>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git commit           # Opens the default text editor to enter the message

6. git log :
Displays a log of commits that have been made to the repository. It shows commit history along with commit messages, authors, and timestamps.
Example>
git log
git log --oneline  # Displays a condensed view of the log

7. git branch :
Lists, creates, or deletes branches. Branches are used to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.
Example>
git branch              # Lists all branches
git branch <branch_name> # Creates a new branch
git branch -d <branch_name> # Deletes a branch

8. git checkout :
Switches to a different branch or commit. It also can be used to restore files from a specific commit.
Examples>
git checkout <branch_name>        # Switches to a branch
git checkout -b <new_branch_name> # Creates a new branch and switches to it
git checkout <commit_hash>        # Checks out a specific commit

9. git merge :
Merges changes from one branch into the current branch. This is how different branches are combined.
Example>
git merge <branch_name>

10. git pull :
Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository to the current branch. It is a combination of git fetch and git merge.
Example>
git pull <remote> <branch>

11. git push :
Sends your committed changes to a remote repository. It updates the remote branch with the changes from your local branch.
Example>
git push <remote> <branch>

12. git fetch :
Downloads commits, files, and references from a remote repository into your local repository, but it does not merge them automatically.
Example>
git fetch <remote>
